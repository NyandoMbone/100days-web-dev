    <p>Betta fish (Betta splendens) are one of the most popular freshwater fish around.

They are best known for their stunning appearance and fiery personality. Their underwater acrobatics can leave you amused for days, and their alluring appearance can captivate even those who do not consider themselves fish people.

Bettas have roughly the same body shape as a Gourami, but their fins are much longer and can come in many different shapes and sizes.</p>
